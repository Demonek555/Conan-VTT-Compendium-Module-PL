  "CONAN.Actor.ActionHeaders.FreeActions.tooltip": "A Free Action is a simple action that can be performed either instantaneously, or within a split second, and requires almost no thought or coordination to accomplish. A Free Action can never include a skill test where dice are rolled. If an action requires a skill test, it is not a Free Action. In a character’s turn, one or more of the following Free Actions can be taken, without reservation, but each specific Free Action can only performed once per turn.",

If the character is not aware of the action, no reaction is allowed. Further, whether or not it succeeds, attempting a Reaction comes at a price: adding Doom to the gamemaster’s pool. Non-player characters attempting Reactions instead pay an equivalent number of points from the Doom pool. The first Reaction a character attempts each round costs 1 point of Doom. The second Reaction costs 2 points of Doom, while the third costs 3 points of Doom, etc. This cost resets to 1 when the character begins a new turn.",

  "CONAN.Actor.ActionHeaders.StandardActions.tooltip": "Standard Actions are the focus of action scenes and take up most of a character’s attention and effort.

  "CONAN.conditionDescriptionBlin": "The character's vision is severly damaged. Upon being blinded, a character suffers 3 [CD] mental damage, and any skill test reliant on vision (normally Observation, Insight, Ranged Weapons, Sailing, etc.) increases in DIfficulty by two steps.",
  "CONAN.conditionDescriptionBurn": "The target is set on fire. This condition lasts for a number of rounds equal to the number of Effects rolled on the attack that inflicted it. If no [CD] were rolled, the cause of the Burning effect will list a duration. At the end of the target's turn, the target suffers X [CD] physical and mental damage (roll once, apply for both), ignoring Armor Soak. Any physical damage caused by Burning X has the Incendiary attack Quality, and Effects rolled increase the number of rounds that the character remains aflame. A character may attempt a Clear Minor Action to remove this effect, while a prone character can spend a Standard Action rolling around, extinguishing the flames. The latter works as a Clear Action but reduces the Difficulty by two steps. If the character is hit by another Burning attack or effect while already ablaze, the existing status is extended by a number of rounds equal to the number of Effects rolled.",

  "CONAN.conditionDescriptionHind": "The character's movement is hindered, slowing them. The character cannot attempt any movement as a Free Action. Further, the character may only move to within Close range as a Minor Action move, and only to within Medium range as a Standard Action move. Finally, the Difficulty of all terrain tests is increased by one step for the character.",
  "CONAN.conditionDescriptionPois": "The character's body suffers the effects of some form of vile toxin. While each poison has a specific effect, the general effect is to grant the character the Staggered condition.",
  "CONAN.conditionDescriptionPron": "While prone, a character gains 2 Soak for each Effect rolled on Cover dice and increases the Difficulty of all Ranged attacks against the character from Medium range or further by one step. However, Melee attacks within Reach and Ranged attacks at Close range gain 2 points of bonus Momentum against the character.",

  "CONAN.qualities.description.area": "The attack affects a wide area and can affect several targets at once. The attack automatically affects any target within Reach of the initial target, and then one additional target within Close range for each Effect rolled, starting with th next closest target (at GMs discretion). If one or more Complications are rolled, GM may choose one of those complications to have the attack hit an ally within the area. Target may attempt Defend Reaction but must attempt a Challenging (D2) skill test. Success of one target does not cover other targets.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.back": "Attacks with this Quality are dangerous to the attacker as well as the enemy. An attack with this Quality inflicts X damage to the attacker for each Effect rolled. This damage ignores Soak and will be of whatever kind of damage the attack inflicts, unless otherwise stated.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.bles": "Blessed items have been enchanted by a god. They contain magic beyond that of mortal sorcery and can bestow special abilities, described in each item’s description. These abilities have the Malediction Quality (see below) equal to X which can be activated as a Minor Action. Unless otherwise stated, they are active for only one turn, and can be used once per scene.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.blin": "If an attack with this Quality inflicts one or more Harms, it instead inflicts the Blind condition, lasting until the end of the scene or until cleared by other means.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.bril": "Brilliant items reflect light in a dazzling fashion. If held to the light, they can often dazzle the unprepared and prevent an attack. To use the Brilliant Quality, the player character must make a Challenging (D2) Thievery test, which can be resisted with either Insight, Parry, or Thievery. If the test is successful, the target is momentarily blinded, suffering the Blind condition for one turn plus one turn for every 2 Momentum spent.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.brit": "Armor made of fragile material does not stand the test of battle well. Any time the armor’s Soak is applied to an attack, that armor’s Soak is permanently reduced by 1. Should it reach 0, the armor is ruined. Damaged armor with the Brittle Quality can be repaired with an Average (D1) Craft test, restoring 1 point of Soak per point of Momentum gained. Destroyed armor with the Brittle Quality must be rebuilt from scratch.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.bulk": "Bulky armor takes up extra space, restricts movement, and is often off-balance, making normal movement difficult and the complex, fluid dance of battle arduous indeed. If wearing Bulky armor on three or more hit locations, the wearer suffers 1 extra Fatigue whenever Fatigue is suffered. Further, they roll one less d20 than normal on Acrobatics, Melee, Parry, and Stealth tests.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.cava": "The attack is launched from horseback and inflicts tremendous damage. The attack inflicts X additional damage to the target for each Effect rolled so long as the attack was made as part of a mounted character's Charge Action.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.cool": "Armor made from wicker is bulky and brittle, but far less hot to wear than other protective options. Cool armors provide 2 points of Soak against stress suffered due to environmental heat, and 1 point of Soak against other heat-related threats.",

  "CONAN.qualities.description.cove": "Cover provides additional Soak against physical attacks (described in Damage and Recovery on page 118) and is normally divided into light cover (providing 2[CD] Soak) and heavy cover (4[CD] Soak). Light cover typically represents lightweight objects that provide little protection, but which obscure the target’s form and position, while heavy cover represents solid objects that can protect from attacks directly.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.curs": "Cursed items, for good or ill, bear contagious magic. When first held by a player character, that character must make a Discipline test equal to X or the spell housed within the item will be immediately cast upon the wielder. Attempting to avoid contact with such an item requires a Sorcery test with a Difficulty equal to one step lower than that Discipline test.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.ench": "Enchanted items have had a spell placed within them. Suggested guidelines for using and creating enchanted items can be found in the Conan corebook on page 143. Where the Enchanted Quality has a value, this indicates the amount of Doom that the player character must pay to activate the item’s spell. Enchanted items do not allow player characters to change the Momentum spends listed into their construction, but a sorcerer possessing an enchanted item can spend a Fortune point to cast its spell as if they had learnt the spell themselves. If a sorcerer chooses to do this, the item confers no additional benefit beyond allowing for the spell to be cast",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.enso": "Ensorcelled items are items that have the capability of harming Horrors and other magical entities. So long as the wielder pays X Doom at the start of combat, Ensorcelled items gain the Piercing X Quality against any creature gaining Soak from being a Horror, and bypass any Soak gained from the Incorporeal special ability.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.fami": "Magic items can include familiars, though such items invariably have the Malediction or Cursed Quality.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.fear": "The attack spreads doubt and panic, inflicting mental damage as well as physical damage. The attack inflicts X mental damage to the target for each Effect rolled, in addition to whatever physical damage was inflicted.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.frag": "These attacks can become less effective over time. For each Effect rolled, reduce the damage rating by 1 [CD] after the attack concludes. If this would reduce the number to 0, then the attack cannot be used again until it has been replaced, repaired, or replenished.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.grap": "In addition to dealing damage, if one or more Effects are rolled the weapon may ensnare the target. An ensnared target is unable to move or take action except to attempt an Acrobatics or Athletics test with a Difficulty equal to the number of Effects rolled. Against an ensnared target, the Difficulty of the Exploit Action is reduced by one step. If the Grappling weapon is a melee weapon, the wielder may not attack with the weapon against anyone else while the target is ensnared. Further, the attacker may not move away from the target without releasing that target; can be released as a Free Action",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.heav": "Attempting any activity outside of combat in this Armor is exhausting and difficult. If wearing Heavy armor on three or more hit locations, your character suffers one additional Fatigue whenever suffering Fatigue normally. If hit locations are not being used, the armor is assumed to cover enough of the body to cause the additional fatigue.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.hidd": "The attack is easy to conceal or designed to be disguised as something else. When the weapon is hidden, any search of the owning character requires an Observation test, with a Difficulty of X to locate it. Immediately after using this attack, the character may spend Momentum to conceal it quickly. This costs two Momentum for attacks with Hidden 1 or Hidden 2, and 1 point of Momentum for attacks with Hidden 3 or higher. This is used when the weapon is concealed, not when it is in use.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.impr": "This item is not designed as a weapon but can be used as such in an impromptu manner. It could be a heavy rock, a wooden torch, or a thick leg bone. When damage is rolled with this weapon, it does not score damage when an Effect is rolled. It is possible for an item to have both the Improvised and Vicious Qualities, cancelling out their effects, but both will be noted in case some factor causes the attack to increase its Vicious Quality, or to lose Improvised.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.ince": "The target is set ablaze and gains the Burning Condition for a number of rounds equal to the number of Effects rolled. At the end of each of the target's turns, the target suffers X [CD] physical damage to a random hit location and suffers the same amount of mental damage (roll once for both). Damage inflicted by Incendiary X ignores Soak. Any Effects rolled on this additional damage increase the number of rounds that the character is aflame, though a character can attempt to remove this condition early as normal.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.inte": "These attacks are designed to inflict massive harm on a target, incapacitating them far more swiftly. If an Intense attack inflicts one or more Harms upon the target, then it inflicts one additional Harm.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.inti": "The right materials and shape of armor can transform the appearance of a combatant from a simple warrior to a demonic presence. While wearing intimidating armor, the wearer rolls +1d20 on any Intimidate tests and rolls a bonus of +2d20 on any Intimidate test made immediately after slaying an opponent with a melee weapon.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.intr": "Intriguing items draw much attention from the great and the good. If an Intriguing item is possessed by a single player character, that player character gains X Gold every Carousing phase, after they’ve paid their Upkeep.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.keen": "The Keen Quality applies only to weapons made of steel. These blades and bludgeons are so strong, they ignore 1 point of Armor Soak per hit. Further, any time an Effect is scored with a Keen weapon, the player may elect to permanently reduce the Armor Soak of the hit location struck until the wearer has an opportunity to repair the damage.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.knoc": "The attack knocks the target prone if one or more Effects are rolled. The target may ignore this if they add 1 Doom for each Effect rolled, or in the case of NPCs, at the cost of 1 Doom per Effect rolled.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.male": "Some items refuse to impart their powers without some form of compensation, and in this case, the price is ill luck in the immediate future. When an item has the Malediction Quality, it can’t be used for any skill test without paying X Doom first.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.nois": "Attempting stealth of any type in this armor is likely to fail. If your character is wearing Noisy armor on two or more hit locations, the Difficulty of all Stealth tests is increased by one step. If hit locations are not being used, the armor is assumed to cover enough of the body that the Difficulty penalty applies.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.nonl": "The attack doesn't inflict lasting damage, instead inflicting a temporary penalty. The attack cannot inflict a normal Harm effect, but rather may only inflict temporary conditions. If the attack has no other Qualities that inflict an alternate Harm, then it inflicts the Dazed Condition until the end of the target's next turn.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.pair": "When used in a pair, the weapons are greatly enhanced. Gaining the specified quality at the value of X. Weapons must be identical, or nearly so. The user cannot use two different weapons for this quality, even if each has the Paired Quality.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.parr": "This weapon is extremely effective at deflecting other attacks. When wielding one or more weapons with this Quality, the Doom cost of making a Defend or Protect Reaction with the Parry skill is reduced by 1, to a minimum of 0.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.patr": "Magic items can include patrons, though such items invariably have the Malediction or Cursed Quality.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.pers": "The attack has a lingering, deleterious effect. If one or more Effects are rolled, the target will suffer X [CD] damage at the start of each subsequent turn for a number of rounds equal to the number of Effects rolled. Each effect rolled on the ongoing damage adds one additional round of duration. This condition can be avoided entirely at the time it is inflicted by adding a number of points to Doom equal to the number of Effects rolled; after this, it can only be removed by waiting for the duration to end or by taking the Clear action.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.pier": "This attack ignores X points of the target's total Soak for each Effect rolled.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.purp": "An item with this type is an armor, weapon, or another piece of equipment of the type stipulated. It has all the abilities and effects of such an item.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.rega": "A regal item is any item which is accepted as a symbol of authority. Using it in a social setting binds the parties that recognize its historical importance but forces the wielder to live up to the importance and legend of the object. Wielders who are deemed unworthy of holding the item will find that allies begin to turn away from them and that they are despised. When used as a part of a Command or Persuade test to create or enforce peace, govern a region, or control an army, the item provides +1d20 to relevant skill tests and bonus Momentum equal to X. If a player character ever fails a test where they have called upon the item’s power, they must pay Doom equal to two times the rating of the Regal Quality.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.sang": "Some items act as mystical powerhouses, capable of storing life energy in the form of a <strong>charm</strong>. When the item inflicts a Wound on a player character or is held by a player character while inflicting a Wound, the user can spend 2 Doom and must perform 1 Minor Action to create a charm which is housed indefinitely within the item. The item can only hold as many charms as it has ranks in Sanguine. Each charm can be exchanged for 1 bonus Momentum to Sorcery tests attempted while in the possession of the item, once per attempt.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.shie": "Shields are extremely effective at affording protection from a range of different attacks. A shield counts as having the Parrying Quality. A shield also allows the wielder to use the Parry skill to make Defend Reactions against ranged attacks in addition to Melee attacks. Further if the Wielder has Guard, a shield grants the wielder X [CD] Cover Soak against Melee and Ranged attacks. Finally, shields may be sacrificed in order to avoid suffering a Wound.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.spre": "This weapon is designed to affect a larger area. For each Effect generated, roll X additional hit locations. These additional hit locations suffer half of the attack's final damage, rounding up. In the case of non-player characters or beings where hit locations are not being used, the target takes the additional damage X times.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.stun": "The attack inflicts the Staggered condition on the target, if one or more Effects are rolled. The condition lasts until the end of the target's next turn. The target may ignore this at the cost of 1 point of Doom for each Effect rolled.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.subt": "The attack is particularly quiet and draws little attention. Any Observation test to detect an attack with this weapon increases in DIfficulty by a number of steps equal to X. This differs from the Hidden Quality in that it is used when the weapon is used, versus when it is concealed.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.thro": "The weapon can be thrown effectively. When throwing a melee weapon with the Thrown Quality, your character does not increase the Difficulty of the Ranged Weapons test. Some weapons may be listed as Thrown (M), in which case they are traeted as ranged weapons with a range of Medium when thrown.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.trap": "Items with the Trapped Quality are trapped in some strange and unusual way. When a player character attempts to steal the item, they immediately generate X Doom for the gamemaster to use in springing a trap. This trap can be avoided if the player character makes a Thievery test with a Difficulty equal to that stated in the trap’s description.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.unfo": "If the target of this attack was affected by an Exploit action immediately before this attack was made, then this attack gains the Intense and Vicious X Qualities.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.veno": "An attack with this Quality can contain Cardiotoxin, Cytotoxin, Hemotoxin or Neurotoxin effects (Horrors of the Hyborian Age, p72).",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.vhea": "This armor is considered as Heavy and Noisy armor. If worn as a full suit it increases the wearer's Courage Soak by 2, due to confidence gained from such sturdy protection. Very Heavy armor must be crafted to the wearer for greatest efficiency. A full suit of Very Heavy armor that has been crafted specifically for the wearer provides Reach 2, even when wielding no other weapons, allowing the character to have a significant advantage in close quarters combat.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.vici": "An attack with this Quality inflicts X additional damage for each Effect rolled.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.voll": "This ranged weapon can be used quickly, allowing the wielder to unleash volleys of projectiles. Thus, wielders often carry bundles of ammunition. An attack with a Volley weapon does not expend any Shots; the user has enough ammunition to last the fight, barring Complications. Further, a Load of ammunition can be spent to perform a Volley, adding a bonus d20 to Ranged Weapons tests to attack, and +1 to the weapon's damage if the attack hits. Loads may also be lost as the result of a Complication. After a fight, spent Loads can be recovered in the same way as Shots.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.warm": "The thick layers of fur armor protect the wearer from extremes of cold. Warm armor provides 2 points of Soak against stress suffered due to environmental cold, and 1 point of Soak against other heat-related threats.",
  "CONAN.qualities.description.weak": "Improvised arrowhead and bolts are of less use against armor forged from stronger materials. Whenever a Weak missile strikes a hit location covered with metal armor and the roll results in any consequences, the arrowhead shatters and the attack deals no damage.",
  "CONAN.qualities.watercraft.agile.description": "These craft can accelerate and decelerate quickly, allowing them to maneuver swiftly in the battle zone. The craft can move one additional zone with any Movement action it takes.",
  "CONAN.qualities.watercraft.agile.name": "Agile",
  "CONAN.qualities.watercraft.deep_draft.description": "A ship with a deep draft can carry more cargo and take rough seas, but can potentially run aground when in shallow waters or in crossing reefs.

  "CONAN.qualities.watercraft.light_craft.description": "These small vessels include skiffs, fishing boats, canoes, and other small boats.
