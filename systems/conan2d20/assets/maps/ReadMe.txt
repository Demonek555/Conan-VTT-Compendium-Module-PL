Hello!

FEEL FREE TO SHARE THESE FILES!
Do not use them commercially!!

These files are fan art and based on the written works on Robert E. Howard.
I did the cartography, but Joseph Hepler and David Thomas provided assistance with getting it aligned with the written information. Their help was essential and invaluable!

All the files in this folder are ISO A2 at 600dpi, so can be printed at ISO A0 at 300 dpi.

If you print this map and stick it on your wall, feel free to send me pictures of it at glynn@monkeyblooddesign.co.uk, I'd love to see it!

Many thanks,
Glynn Seal
