# Robert E. Howard's Conan (2D20) For FoundryVTT

Community contributed and maintained system for playing Robert E Howard's Conan 2D20 system with FoundryVTT (https://foundryvtt.com/) produced with explicit consent from Modiphius Entertainment.

Robert E. Howard's Conan is based on the 2D20 cinematic system developped by Modiphius Entertainment (https://www.modiphius.net/) through their kickstarter (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/modiphius/robert-e-howards-conan-roleplaying-game).

### Contributions

@Hooking was generous enough to let us reuse the item selector from his game system [Foundry VTT Pathfinder 2e (PF2e)](https://gitlab.com/hooking/foundry-vtt---pathfinder-2e). That piece of code was contributed by `an unkown contributor` on the PF2e game system. MOST of this project has been very heavily influenced by [Foundry VTT Pathfinder 2E](https://gitlab.com/hooking/foundry-vtt---pathfinder-2e). All credit to their previous work and generosity.

Many thanks to Glynn Seal of [MonkeyBlood Design & Publishing](http://monkeyblooddesign.co.uk/store) for allowing us to include [The Lands of the Hyborian Age](https://monkeyblooddesign.co.uk/2022/06/25/conan-age-of-hyboria-map/) maps.  These maps are for non-commercial use only and were created by Glynn Seal, Joseph Hepler and David Thomas.

Many thanks go to the following people for their assistance with providing language translations for the system interface:
